  <strong>I am a third-year PhD student at UC San Diego, 
  advised by <a href="https://roseyu.com/">Prof. Rose Yu</a> and <a href="https://duncanwp.github.io/">Prof. Duncan Watson-Parris</a></strong>.

  My goal is to develop and use machine learning (ML) methods for positive real-world impact in areas like 
  <em>climate modeling, weather forecasting and sustainability</em>. 
  On the ML side, I am particularly interested in <em>self-supervised
  learning, large-scale forecasting, and generative modeling</em>.

I was a research intern at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) during the summers of 2023 and 2022, focusing on machine learning for climate modeling.
Before, I had the pleasure to work with <a href="https://davidrolnick.com/">Prof. David Rolnick</a>
on climate change+ML at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
I got started in ML research through a project on weakly supervised learning
with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~boecking/">Ben Boecking</a> and
<a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/"> Prof. Artur Dubrawski</a>
at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University's</a> <a href="https://www.autonlab.org/">Auton Lab</a>.

I also led a <a href="https://youtu.be/pqpF4m9k3bo">diverse team of fellow undergraduates</a>
in our research project on improving El Ni√±o forecasts with graph neural networks, in terms of both performance and interpretability.
We were supported by a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth-grants">Microsoft AI for Earth grant</a>
(<a href="https://ai4edatasetspublicassets.blob.core.windows.net/grantee-profiles/Salva%20Ruhling%20Cachay_EMEA_Climate_AI4E%20Grantee%20Profile_Final.pdf">see our spotlighted profile</a>).

I am German-Peruvian, and was privileged to be able to grow up in both countries
and that volunteering/work enabled me to have a wonderful time living
in Colombia, India, and Canada for extended periods of time.
I enjoy immersing myself into nature and new cultures, dancing, beach life, and exotic fruits.

I'm particularly happy to support underrepresented minorities :)
